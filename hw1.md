Exercise 1.2
============

We used K-nearest neighbors to build a predictive model for price, given
mileage, separately for each of two trim levels: 350 and 65 AMG. In
order to do this, we divided our data into 2 subgroups, 350 and 65 AMG,
and got rid of all the other data.

### Sclass 350

First, we’ll look on the Sclass 350 data. We can see there’s a negative
relationship between mileage and price plotted as below
