# Exercise 1.1
We used K-nearest neighbors to build a predictive model for price, given mileage, separately for each of two trim levels: 350 and 65 AMG.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
